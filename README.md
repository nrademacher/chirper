##A MERN-stack Twitter clone (WIP)

A simple Twitter-like fullstack app using the MERN (MondoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJs) stack, as well as Redux on the frontend as the app's state container.

JWT (JSON Web tokens) is used to handle user authentication.

### Getting started

Run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `yarn dev` in root directory to start up both backend and frontend in development mode.
